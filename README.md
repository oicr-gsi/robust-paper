# Ten Simple Rules for Making Research Software More Robust

Software produced for research, even published software, suffers from a number of common problems that make it difficult, if not impossible, to run outside the original institution or even the primary developer's computer. We present ten simple rules to make your software robust enough to run anywhere and delight your users and collaborators.

Reviewers say: "This is a very strong manuscript that should be read by everyone developing bioinformatics software, whether individual scripts or larger pieces of infrastructure."
