abstract ={High-throughput data production technologies, particularly ‘next-generation’ DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.},

abstract ={The Bioperl project is an international open-source collaboration of biologists, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists that has evolved over the past 7 yr into the most comprehensive library of Perl modules available for managing and manipulating life-science information. Bioperl provides an easy-to-use, stable, and consistent programming interface for bioinformatics application programmers. The Bioperl modules have been successfully and repeatedly used to reduce otherwise complex tasks to only a few lines of code. The Bioperl object model has been proven to be flexible enough to support enterprise-level applications such as EnsEMBL, while maintaining an easy learning curve for novice Perl programmers. Bioperl is capable of executing analyses and processing results from programs such as BLAST, ClustalW, or the EMBOSS suite. Interoperation with modules written in Python and Java is supported through the evolving BioCORBA bridge. Bioperl provides access to data stores such as GenBank and SwissProt via a flexible series of sequence input/output modules, and to the emerging common sequence data storage format of the Open Bioinformatics Database Access project. This study describes the overall architecture of the toolkit, the problem domains that it addresses, and gives specific examples of how the toolkit can be used to solve common life-sciences problems. We conclude with a discussion of how the open-source nature of the project has contributed to the development effort.[Supplemental material is available online at www.genome.org. Bioperl is available as open-source software free of charge and is licensed under the Perl Artistic License (http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/misc/Artistic.html). It is available for download at http://www.bioperl.org. Support inquiries should be addressed to bioperl-l@bioperl.org.]},

abstract={Areas of life sciences research that were previously distant from each other in ideology, analysis practices and toolkits, such as microbial ecology and personalized medicine, have all embraced techniques that rely on next-generation sequencing instruments. Yet the capacity to generate the data greatly outpaces our ability to analyse it. Existing sequencing technologies are more mature and accessible than the methodologies that are available for individual researchers to move, store, analyse and present data in a fashion that is transparent and reproducible. Here we discuss currently pressing issues with analysis, interpretation, reproducibility and accessibility of these data, and we present promising solutions and venture into potential future developments.},
